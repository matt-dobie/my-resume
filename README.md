## Side Projects

### Portfolio Website
As a developer, it's vital to have my own space on the web to display any relevant projects that I've worked on. [This](http://mattdobie.com) is the third version of that portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages, and developed with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, JavaScript and jQuery. The current version takes advantage of a responsive single page layout, which allows my work to be viewed on any device.

### Local Weather App
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) intermediate projects, and its purpose is to display the user's local weather conditions. I used HTML5 Geolocation to obtain location data, the Dark Sky API to provide the weather information, and the Bootstrap 4 framework to ensure that the page was available on all devices. The biggest challenge was to learn how to interact with the Dark Sky API and JSON data, but I am also especially proud of the visual design, with its bright weather-dependent colours and clean layout.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
The goal of this project was to create my own playable version of Tic-Tac-Toe, and it was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) advanced front-end projects. The game includes a multiplayer mode for the user to play against a friend, as well as a single-player mode with four different levels of difficulty. To achieve this I had to build an AI system with object-oriented JavaScript based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax Algorithm</a> - a system that allows the computer to actually decide what is the best move to make during its turn. Developing the AI was by far the most challenging and exciting aspect of the project.

### NodeJS API Projects
A selection of API microservices built with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB, and hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). These include a URL Shortener similar to TinyURL, and an Image Search Microservice.
