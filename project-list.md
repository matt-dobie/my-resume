## Front-End

### Portfolio Site
#### HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and jQuery
As a student of web development looking to start a career in the field, it's vital to have my own space on the web to display any relevant projects that I've worked on. [This](http://mattdobie.com) is the third version of that portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages, and developed with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, JavaScript and jQuery. The current version takes advantage of a responsive single page layout, which allows my work to be viewed on any device.

### Simon Game
#### CSS3 and JavaScript
This game was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) advanced front-end projects. The goal was to create my own version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)" target="_blank">Simon</a>, a memory-based game where the user has to watch a set of four buttons light up in a specific sequence. After the user successfully replicates the sequence via button presses, a new light is added to the sequence and another round begins. Each time the pattern is longer and thus the difficulty increases, with the ultimate goal being to remember a sequence of 20 lights.

For this project there were two main challenges: the CSS and the JavaScript game logic. Working out how to construct the centred circular shapes and curved buttons via CSS was particularly challenging, but I am quite happy with the result!

### Tic-Tac-Toe
#### JavaScript and jQuery
The goal of this project was to create my own playable version of Tic-Tac-Toe, and it was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) advanced front-end projects. The game includes a multiplayer mode for the user to play against a friend, as well as a single-player mode with four different levels of difficulty. To achieve this I had to build an AI system in JavaScript based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax Algorithm</a> - a system that allows the computer to actually decide what is the best move to make during its turn. Developing the AI was by far the most challenging and exciting aspect of the project.

### JavaScript Calculator
#### JavaScript and jQuery
This web app was developed as one of freeCodeCamp's advanced front-end projects. To replicate the look and feel of a simple calculator I used JavaScript for the logic/arithmetic, jQuery for any interaction with the page itself, and CSS for the styling. I enjoyed the challenge of diving deeper into JavaScript programming, and especially the challenge of incorporating the intricacies of the user experience that we often take for granted when using a calculator (eg. negative numbers).

### Wikipedia Viewer
#### JavaScript and MediaWiki API
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) intermediate projects. The goal was to provide the user with a simple and intuitive way to either search for a Wikipedia article, or to read a randomly generated article. This was achieved through a combination of CSS3 and jQuery for a responsive and animated design, and the MediaWiki API to pull the appropriate article information. Developing the user interface was the most time consuming and rewarding part of this project.</p>

### Local Weather
#### jQuery and Dark Sky API
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) intermediate projects, and its purpose is to display the user's local weather conditions. I used HTML5 Geolocation to obtain location data, the Dark Sky API to provide the weather information, and the Bootstrap 4 framework to ensure that the page was available on all devices. The biggest challenge was to learn how to interact with the Dark Sky API and JSON data, but I am also especially proud of the visual design, with its bright weather-dependent colours and clean layout.

### Pomodoro Clock
#### JavaScript and jQuery
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) advanced front-end projects. The goal was to create my own version of a Pomodoro Clock which, using the Pomodoro Technique, helps the user to increase their productivity by scheduling alternating periods of work and break time. It was created with JavaScript, jQuery and CSS. This project was challenging, but I enjoyed gaining a better knowledge of JavaScript timing and overcoming its slight (but significant) inaccuracies.

### Twitch Tracker
#### JavaScript and Bootstrap
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) intermediate front-end projects. It uses the Twitch.tv JSON API to detect whether each Twitch channel from a selected list is online or not, and to provide the main information about the channel to the user. I achieved this using Bootstrap 4, CSS and jQuery. The trickiest aspect of this project was to get the page layout to scale like I wanted it to, but I am quite happy with the result.

### Random Quote Machine
#### JavaScript and jQuery
This web app was developed as one of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) intermediate front-end projects. The aim was simply to allow the user to randomly generate famous quotes, both from real people and characters in movies. The clean minimalist layout was created using Bootstrap 4, and the quotes themselves were generated using the Random Famous Quotes API and JavaScript. This was my first experience interacting with an API, and I learned a lot during the development process.

### Hans Zimmer Tribute Page
#### Bootstrap and CSS
My very first project as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie) curriculum. The goal was to create a single-page tribute website for "someone" or "something" that interests me. I had recently seen the famous film composer Hans Zimmer in concert, and I find his music to be passionate and awe-inspiring. This page uses HTML5, Bootstrap 4 and some simple CSS to create a great looking and concise, yet informative, web page. Considering my lack of experience with visual design I am very happy with the result of my first Front-end project.

## Back-End

At this stage my Back-end experience mainly consists of a selection of APIs built with NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS and MongoDB. All of these projects are hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

### Image Search Microservice
An API that allows the user to search for images and returns the results in JSON format. After completing the URL Shortener Microservice (see below), this project was not too difficult. However, it provided another opportunity to improve my skills interacting with a MongoDB database, which was used to store a history of search terms. The latest ten search terms can be accessed by any user at any time.

### URL Shortener Microservice
An API that takes a regular URL and returns a shortened URL, similar to a service such as TinyURL. This shortened URL redirects the user to the original site. To achieve this a database was required, so the project was my first time using MongoDB. I used mLab to host the database, which stores each URL and its corresponding shortened version. 

Another important component was to learn how to hide private information (eg. database username and password) in a hidden .env file that can't be accessed by outside users. However, learning how to add, find and interact with the database was still by far the most challenging and exciting aspect of the project.

### Request Header Parser Microservice
An API that returns the user's browser information (IP, language and operating system) as a JSON object. This project wasn't too difficult, but it further solidified my skills in setting up a file structure for a basic NodeJS application. I also learned more about the 'request' object in an ExpressJS GET request, and how to interact with it.

### Timestamp Microservice
An API that takes either a unix timestamp or a natural language date, and returns a JSON object with the date formatted in BOTH versions. This was my first API project at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/matt-dobie). The biggest challenge to overcome was to learn how to setup, layout and structure my code for a Back-end application. I also learned how to install packages with NPM on both [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), and a local environment.
